# EDA-and-Linear-Regresssion
## 📚 Learning Note

This project is a part of my learning journey.  
I followed a tutorial from the YouTube channel to understand how to perform EDA and build a Linear Regression model in Python.

The code and concepts are directly based on the video:  
[Linear Regression in Python – Full Project for Beginners](https://youtu.be/O2Cw82YR5Bo)

I created this notebook to practice what I learned and reinforce my understanding.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and build a **Linear Regression model** using Python. It uses a sample e-commerce dataset to analyze customer behavior and predict yearly spending based on factors like time on website, time on app, and membership duration.
